Subject: [PATCH] Fix mcrypt_create_iv(..., MCRYPT_RAND) to auto-seed RNG

Summary: Without seeding the random number generator,
we'll always get the same IV, and that reduces the security
of this function.

Fortunately, f_rand() has all of that logic for auto-seeding
and selection of a suitable initial seed built-in.

Realistically, using MCRYPT_RAND should be deprecated.
I'm going to wait on PHP Internals to make a decision on
https://wiki.php.net/rfc/deprecate_mcrypt_rand
before adding that warning however, so that our test suite
remains consistent.
